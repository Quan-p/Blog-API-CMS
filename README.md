# Blog CMS

This repo is specifically for the CMS side of the Blog-API project. The rest of the project consists of a REST API only backend as well as a client-side frontend. A separate website for the client facing blog was created and is linked below along with the repo for the API.

## About the Project

This full stack web app was part of the self-taught education of The Odin Project NodeJS Curriculum.

Creating a blog from the ground up was an opportunity to further develop REST API skills and to demonstrate the power and flexibility of separating backend code from frontend code.
